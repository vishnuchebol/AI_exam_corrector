Student: Overachiever

1) T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n
a=2, b=2, f(n)=n.
Case 2 of Master Thm.
T(n) = n log n.

2) Sum of odd integers = n^2.
Base Case: n=1, 1^2=1.
Inductive Step: Assume for k.
Sum(k+1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k+1)^2.
QED.

3) BFS vs DFS
BFS: Queue, Level-order, Shortest Path.
DFS: Stack, Pre-order/Post-order, Topological Sort.

4) BONUS: What is P vs NP?
P is the set of problems solvable in polynomial time. NP is the set of problems verifiable in polynomial time. P vs NP asks if P=NP.
