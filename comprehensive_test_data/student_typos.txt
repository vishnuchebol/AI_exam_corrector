1) T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n
a=2, b=2, fn=n
n^log_2(2) = n.
Since f(n) matchhes n, its Case 2.
Ans: Theta(nlogn).

2) Prof by Indction:
Base Case: n=1, sum is 1. One squared is 1. Good.
Hypothesis: Assume k holds.
Step: Add next odd num (2k+1) to sum.
k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k+1)^2.
So it is tru.

3) BSF vs DSF
BSF usses a Queee to go layer by layer. Best for shorttest paths.
DSF uses a Stck to go deep. Good for puzzels.
