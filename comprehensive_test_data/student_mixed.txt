1) T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n
a=2, b=2, f(n)=n.
n^log_b(a) = n^1 = n.
Since f(n) = n, this is Case 2.
T(n) = Theta(n log n).

2) Proof Attempt:
Base Case: n=1, 1=1. Correct.
Inductive Step:
Assume S(k) = k^2.
We need to show S(k+1) = (k+1)^2.
S(k+1) = S(k) + k = k^2 + k.
(This logic is incomplete and incorrect for the odd integer sum problem).

3) BFS vs DFS
BFS uses a Stack and goes deep first.
DFS uses a Queue and visits level by level.
(This is swapped/wrong).
