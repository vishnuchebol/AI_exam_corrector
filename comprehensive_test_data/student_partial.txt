1) T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n
a=2, b=2.
n^(log_2 2) = n.
So T(n) = O(n).
(Forgot the log n factor)

2) Base Case: n=1, 1=1.
Assume for k.
For k+1:
Sum = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k+1)^2.
(Skipped the inductive hypothesis statement explicitly but did the math)

3) BFS uses a Stack. DFS uses a Queue.
BFS goes deep, DFS goes wide.
(Got them completely mixed up)
