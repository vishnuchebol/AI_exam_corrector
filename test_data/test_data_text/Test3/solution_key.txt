1) Solve the recurrence relation T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n.
Solution:
Using the Master Theorem:
a = 2, b = 2, f(n) = n.
n^(log_b a) = n^(log_2 2) = n^1 = n.
Since f(n) = Theta(n^(log_b a)), this is Case 2.
Therefore, T(n) = Theta(n log n).

2) Prove that the sum of the first n odd integers is n^2.
Solution:
Proof by Induction.
Base Case (n=1): Sum = 1. n^2 = 1^2 = 1. Holds.
Inductive Hypothesis: Assume true for n=k. Sum(k) = k^2.
Inductive Step: Show for n=k+1.
Sum(k+1) = Sum(k) + (2(k+1)-1)
         = k^2 + 2k + 2 - 1
         = k^2 + 2k + 1
         = (k+1)^2.
Q.E.D.

3) Explain the difference between BFS and DFS.
Solution:
BFS (Breadth-First Search) explores neighbors layer by layer using a Queue data structure. It is optimal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
DFS (Depth-First Search) explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking, using a Stack (or recursion). It is useful for topological sorting and cycle detection.

- Mentioning Queue vs Stack: 2 marks
- Mentioning traversal order (Layer vs Deep): 2 marks
- Mentioning one application for each: 1 mark
