1) T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n
I will use the Recursion Tree Method.
Level 0: n
Level 1: n/2 + n/2 = n
Level 2: n/4 + n/4 + n/4 + n/4 = n
...
Height of tree is log_2 n.
Total work = Sum of work at each level * height
           = n * log n
           = Theta(n log n).

2) I will prove this geometrically.
Imagine a square grid of size n x n.
For n=1, we have 1 dot.
For n=2, we add 3 dots around it to make a 2x2 square.
For n=3, we add 5 dots around the 2x2 square to make a 3x3 square.
In general, to go from n to n+1, we add (2n+1) dots, which is the next odd number.
Thus the sum is n^2.

3) BFS is like a wave expanding from the source. DFS is like a maze solver following a wall.
BFS uses FIFO, DFS uses LIFO.
