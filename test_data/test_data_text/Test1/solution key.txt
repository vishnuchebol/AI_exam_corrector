1) Define the term 'Diffusion' and state one example in biology.
Diffusion is the net movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, down a concentration gradient.
Marking Scheme: 1 mark for the definition of net movement/higher to lower concentration. 1 mark for stating a correct biological example (e.g., gas exchange in lungs). Total: 2 marks.

2) Explain the role of the ozone layer in the Earth's atmosphere.
The ozone layer (a region in the stratosphere with high ozone concentration) primarily absorbs most of the Sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This absorption prevents dangerous UV rays from reaching the Earth's surface, protecting life forms.
Marking Scheme: 1 mark for stating it absorbs UV radiation. 1 mark for explaining the purpose (protects life/prevents radiation from reaching the surface). Total: 2 marks.

3) What is the function of the ribosome in a eukaryotic cell?
The ribosome is the organelle responsible for protein synthesis (or translation). It reads the mRNA sequence and uses that information to assemble amino acids into a polypeptide chain (a protein).
Marking Scheme: 1 mark for stating its function is protein synthesis/translation. 1 mark for mentioning it assembles amino acids/polypeptide chain. Total: 2 marks.
