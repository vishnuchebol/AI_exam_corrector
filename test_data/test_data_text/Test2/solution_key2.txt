1) Define a proposition and create a truth table for the AND (∧) operator.
A proposition is a declarative statement that is either true or false, but not both.
Truth Table for AND (p ∧ q):
p | q | p ∧ q
--|---|------
T | T | T
T | F | F
F | T | F
F | F | F
Marking Scheme: 1 mark for the correct definition of a proposition. 1 mark for the correct truth table. Total: 2 marks.

2) Given set A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 3}, find the Power Set of A and the intersection A ∩ B.
The Power Set of A, P(A), is the set of all subsets of A. P(A) = { ∅, {1}, {2}, {1, 2} }.
The intersection A ∩ B is the set of elements common to both A and B. A ∩ B = {2}.
Marking Scheme: 2 marks for the correct power set (must include all 4 elements, including the empty set). 1 mark for the correct intersection. Total: 3 marks.

3) What is a 'simple graph' in graph theory?
A simple graph is an undirected graph that has no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no parallel edges (more than one edge connecting the same pair of vertices).
Marking Scheme: 1 mark for mentioning 'no loops'. 1 mark for mentioning 'no parallel edges'. Total: 2 marks.

4) Prove that if $n^2$ is an even integer, then $n$ must also be an even integer.
We will prove the contrapositive: "If $n$ is odd, then $n^2$ is odd."
Let $n$ be an odd integer. By definition, $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$.
Now, we square $n$:
$n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1$
$n^2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$
Let $m = 2k^2 + 2k$. Since $k$ is an integer, $m$ is also an integer.
So, $n^2 = 2m + 1$, which is the definition of an odd integer.
Because we have proven the contrapositive (if $n$ is odd, $n^2$ is odd) is true, the original statement (if $n^2$ is even, $n$ is even) must also be true.
Marking Scheme: 1 mark for identifying a valid proof method (contrapositive, contradiction). 2 marks for the correct algebraic steps. 1 mark for the correct logical conclusion. Total: 4 marks.
