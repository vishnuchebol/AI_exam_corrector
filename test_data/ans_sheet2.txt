1) A proposition is a statement that is true or false.
Truth Table:
p | q | AND
--|---|----
T | T | T
T | F | F
F | T | F
F | F | F

2) The Power Set of A is { {1}, {2}, {1, 2} }.
The intersection is {2}.

3) A simple graph is a graph that is not complicated. It only has a few vertices and edges and no loops.

4) I will use proof by contradiction.
Assume the statement is false. This means we assume that $n^2$ is even, but $n$ is odd.
If $n$ is odd, then by definition, $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$.
Let's square it:
$n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1$
$n^2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$
This shows that $n^2$ is an odd number.
This is a contradiction, because our initial assumption was that $n^2$ is even.
Therefore, our assumption must be false, and the original statement is true.
